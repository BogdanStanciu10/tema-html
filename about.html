            <img src="images/30.jpg" alt="main-banner">
            <h4>Without the city’s turmoil and crowd, the wonderful landscapes that surrounds the Arcon restaurant, offers the kind of intimacy that we sometimes hope with so much impatience.</h4>
            <h5>TERRACE</h5>
            <p>The terrace is the perfect place to enjoy your meal or an open-air drink on the edge of the lake, away from all urban agitation.</p>
            <h5>LAKE VIEW</h5>
            <p>The quiet water and the soft breeze among the tree branches, makes the Arcon landscape one that conquers all eyes.</p>
            <h5>BARS FROM THE INTERIOR</h5>
            <p>We offer not one, but two bars inside. And the masters in the preparation and mixing of beverages are fighting to get some liquors full of flavor for you.</p>
            <h5>ECLECTIC DESIGN</h5>
            <p>Eclectic décor with scandinavian accents that blend perfectly with rustic style, is the perfect setting for your event.</p>

        <h1>RESTAURANT</h1>

            <h2>You deserve a break today... at Arcon's.</h2>
            <img src="images/bg_2.jpg" width="570" alt="restaurant-banner">
            <h4>From the love of gastronomy, passion for harmonious blending of spices and ingredients to conquer any taste buds, we created the Arcon Restaurant – a stylish location where fun and relaxation are closely connected with the mood of those who pass the threshold.</h4>
            <p>The Arcon restaurant is a two-level building, originally thought to host a rustic restaurant. But then, we decided that people need rather a contemporary space, less conventional, but welcoming. </p>

            <h2>CHEF’S MESSAGE</h2>
            <p><q>Take a seat, admire the view and let it load you with positive energy; allow yourself a relaxing break. We are committed to serve you only freshly prepared dishes and carefully placed food in the plate.</q></p>
            <p><q>It will take 10-15 minutes longer than you are accustomed to expect an order, but this time allows us to offer you prepared food in real time.</q></p>
            <p><q>Without semi-prepared foods and de-frozen vegetables; you have the guarantee that the red pepper that complements your “plating” (the way the dish is arranged) was washed, cut and fried, especially to give you an unforgettable experience.</q></p>
